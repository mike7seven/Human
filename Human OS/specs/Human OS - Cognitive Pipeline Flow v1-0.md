# 🚀 Human OS — Cognitive Pipeline Flow v1.0 (Template)

A universal template for mapping human cognitive processing, built like a CI/CD/Dataflow/ETL pipeline but tuned to how the human mind operates.

**Use this template as a starting point, then customize it to match your own cognitive patterns. Ask your LLM of choice to help you identify where your personal flow differs.**

---

## Pipeline Overview

This is the full mental dataflow from "input enters your system" → "task completes or exits."

## Stage-by-Stage Walkthrough

### 📥 1. EXTERNAL INPUTS

Everything entering your cognitive system.

Common sources:
- Tasks and responsibilities
- Ideas and inspiration
- Worries and concerns
- Social interactions
- Notifications and interruptions
- Internal thoughts and memories
- Physical sensations

*Personalization note: Input volume and sensitivity varies greatly. Some people experience this as a firehose; others have natural filtering.*

---

### 🚦 2. INGESTION GATEWAY

The initial receiving and parsing stage.

This step:
- Receives the input
- Does initial relevance check
- Begins categorization
- Routes to appropriate queue

*Personalization note: Some people have strong natural gatekeeping; others let most inputs through.*

---

### 💜 3. EMOTIONAL FILTER

The felt-sense check that influences all downstream processing.

This layer asks:
- How does this feel in the body?
- Is there an emotional charge?
- Does this trigger anxiety, excitement, dread, curiosity?
- Should this be prioritized or avoided based on feeling?

This filter can:
- Accelerate important items
- Block or delay uncomfortable items
- Completely override logical prioritization

*Personalization note: Emotional filtering strength varies. Some people are highly driven by this layer; others can bypass it more easily.*

---

### 🔀 4. THREE ROUTING QUEUES

#### 4.1 CAPTURE BUFFER
For thoughts, ideas, and inputs that need to be noted but not acted on immediately:
- Sudden ideas
- Things to remember
- Observations
- Creative sparks

*Personalization note: Some people have very active capture buffers with constant ideation; others have quieter ones.*

#### 4.2 WORKING QUEUE
Active items ready for processing:
- Current tasks
- Decisions to make
- Problems to solve
- Conversations to have

This is your RAM for active thinking.

#### 4.3 BACKBURNER STORAGE
Items for later:
- Long-term projects
- Someday/maybe items
- Ideas to revisit
- Low-priority tasks

*Personalization note: Backburner retrieval varies. Some people naturally resurface items; others need external systems.*

---

### 🧠 5. FOREGROUND OPS (Active Focus)

Your main processing thread.

Handles:
- Active task execution
- Focused attention
- Decision-making
- Problem-solving

Possible states:
- **Focused** — steady productive attention
- **Flow** — deep immersion, time disappears
- **Scattered** — difficulty maintaining thread
- **Stuck** — unable to proceed
- **Overwhelmed** — too many inputs, system slowdown

*Personalization note: Focus duration, depth, and stability vary significantly between individuals.*

---

### 🔄 6. BACKGROUND PROCESSOR (Optional)

Subconscious or passive processing that happens without active attention.

Can handle:
- Problem incubation
- Creative connections
- Memory consolidation
- Pattern recognition

*Personalization note: Background processing capacity varies greatly. Some people can "offload" tasks effectively; others need to consciously work through everything.*

---

### 🧪 7. EXECUTION ENGINE

Where work actually happens:
- Writing, building, creating
- Speaking, communicating
- Deciding, committing
- Physical actions

Key factors:
- Energy level
- Skill/familiarity
- Motivation
- Environmental conditions

---

### ✔️ 8. VALIDATION GATE

The completion checkpoint:
- Is this done?
- Does it meet requirements?
- Is it good enough?
- Should it loop back for more work?

**Critical insight:** Items that enter the system but never pass the Validation Gate remain open. Too many open items consume cognitive resources and can cause overwhelm.

*Personalization note: Some people close loops naturally; others struggle with completion and need explicit systems.*

---

### 🗃️ 9. COMMIT / CLOSE

The release stage:
- Context unloads
- Mental space clears
- Item is marked complete
- Resources freed

This step prevents:
- Cognitive overload
- Exhaustion from too many open threads
- The "I can't relax" feeling

---

### 🌙 10. ARCHIVE / DONE

Full completion. The item is:
- Stored in long-term memory (if relevant)
- Released from active/background processing
- Fully closed

This is where genuine closure happens.

---

### ⚡ 11. ENERGY/CAPACITY MONITOR

A meta-system that affects ALL stages:
- Current energy level
- Time of day effects
- Stress load
- Physical state (sleep, hunger, health)
- Emotional bandwidth

When capacity is low:
- Ingestion gateway tightens
- Execution quality drops
- Validation standards may slip
- Recovery becomes priority

---

## Customization Prompts

Use these questions to map your own cognitive pipeline:

1. **Input volume:** Is your external input a trickle, stream, or firehose?
2. **Emotional filtering:** How much does feeling drive your prioritization?
3. **Capture buffer:** How active is your ideation? Do you have lots of "random" thoughts?
4. **Background processing:** Can you offload problems and let them "cook"?
5. **Focus states:** What states do you experience? Flow? Hyperfocus? Paralysis?
6. **Loop closure:** Do you naturally complete things, or do items stay open?
7. **Energy sensitivity:** How much does your capacity fluctuate?
